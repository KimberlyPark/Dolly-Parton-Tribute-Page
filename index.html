           Dolly Rebecca Parton was born on January 19, 1946 in Pittman Center, Tennessee, in a one-room cabin on the banks of the Little Pigeon River, and nestled against the Great Smoky Mountains. She was exposed to music through family members and especially her mother, who sang and played guitar. She also learned about music by performing at church at an early age.</p>
          
          <p> Dolly was given her first guitar at a young age and starting to write songs. By the age of ten she started performing professionally on local television and radio shows based out of Knoxville. Dolly made her Grand Ole Opry debut when she was just thirteen years old. She moved to Nashville after she finished high school to pursue a career in music.</p>
          
           <p>In 1967, Dolly partnered with Portor Wagoner on <em>The Porter Wagoner Show</em>. Dolly's high skills as a singer/songwriter, known for thoughtful narratives and distinct vocals, soon catapulted her to super-stardom. Ever since then, her songs have captured the heart of millions.</p>
          
           <p> Today, Dolly is one of an elite group of individuals to receive at least on nomination from all four major annual American entertainment award organizations; Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony. In 2006, she was selected to receive the distinguished Kennedy Center Honors. Five years later in 2011, she was awarded a Grammy lifetime Achievement Award.</p></div>
